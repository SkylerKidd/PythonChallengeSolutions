## How It Works

The Python Challenge (http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) is an online series of puzzles that are intended to be solved with some form of scripting. While only 2 of the 33 challenges must be solved in Python, specifically, the challenged are designed to be easily solved with Python.

The general format of each problem is to create a script to process a provided set of data which should result in the next url for the riddle.

## Challenges

### Challenge 0

This first one is simply an introduction to the format of answering the puzzle.

The puzzle is a picture of **2<sup>38</sup>**. We can quickly solve for this in Python with:
```
2**38
```

Replacing the **0** in the url with the result (**274877906944**) gets us to the next challenge.
